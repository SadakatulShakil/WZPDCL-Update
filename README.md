# wzpdcl_app_flutter

A ADN diginet project

## Getting Started

In order to read the documentation in an http server, I have used the following:

* [dartdoc](https://pub.dev/packages/dartdoc/install)
* [dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd)

After downloading dartdoc, add it to path. Then use commands:

1. dartdoc
2. dhttpd --path doc/api

**Important**
* Use packages with null-safety otherwise the releasing the app might crash
* For releasing the app, read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55536637/how-to-build-signed-apk-from-android-studio-for-flutter)
